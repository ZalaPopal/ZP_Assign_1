        <p>
            The red panda (Ailurus fulgens), also known as the lesser panda, is a small mammal native 
            to the eastern Himalayas and southwestern China.
            <br> It has dense reddish-brown fur with a black belly and legs,
            white-lined ears, a mostly white muzzle and a ringed tail.
            <br> Its head-to-body length is 51–63.5 cm (20.1–25.0 in)
            with a 28–48.5 cm (11.0–19.1 in) tail, and it weighs between 3.2 and 15 kg (7.1 and 33.1 lb).
            <br> It is well 
            adapted to climbing due to its flexible joints and curved semi-retractile claws.
